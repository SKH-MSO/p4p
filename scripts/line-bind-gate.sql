--  P4P — Best-effort (with alerting) capture of every physician's LINE userId
-- ============================================================================
--  Run scripts/bind-line-user.sql and scripts/line-user-id-columns.sql FIRST.
--
--  Context: bind_line_user_id() was previously best-effort AND SILENT — any
--  failure (LIFF scope, network, etc.) was swallowed and login proceeded with
--  no binding recorded and nobody notified. The goal now is to know every
--  physician's LINE userId as of their first verification, ENFORCED on every
--  gated page load — but bounded: after BIND_ATTEMPT_LIMIT failures the
--  physician is let through with a one-time admin alert instead of being locked
--  out over a device/permission fault they can't fix. So it is best-effort with
--  hard alerting, not an absolute guarantee. This adds:
--
--    1. line_bind_attempts — counts failed bind attempts per email (separate
--       from line_user_bindings, which only ever holds SUCCESSFUL binds).
--    2. record_bind_failure() — called by the client when a bind attempt
--       fails. After 3 failed attempts, fires one Telegram alert (same Vault
--       secrets as notify_access_request()) and never repeats it, so an
--       admin can manually follow up instead of the physician being blocked
--       forever over a device/permission issue outside their control.
--    3. get_line_bind_gate_status(email) — single-round-trip status check
--       used by main.js on every gated-page request: is this email blocked,
--       is it already bound, and how many failed attempts so far. Callable
--       by anon (same posture as is_sender_allowlisted — a yes/no/count
--       oracle, never exposes the underlying rows).
--
--  bind_line_user_id() is also updated to clear out any attempts row once a
--  bind actually succeeds (tidy-up; the gate stops mattering for that email
--  the moment line_user_bindings has a row for it regardless).
