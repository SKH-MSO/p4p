--  P4P — Bind LINE userId to a verified email (first verification wins)
-- ============================================================================
--  Purpose: pure traceability, NOT an auth factor. When a physician completes
--  email OTP verification, the LIFF SDK's liff.getProfile() gives the app
--  their LINE userId. Recording it against their email lets an admin answer
--  "which LINE account is behind this email?" — e.g. while investigating a
--  suspicious access request, or confirming who actually submitted P4P data.
--
--  The binding is set once and never overwritten (ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE only
--  refreshes the display name, which can legitimately change over time — the
--  userId/bound_at from the FIRST successful verification stick permanently).
--  If the same email later verifies from a different LINE account, this table
--  will still show the original userId — that mismatch is exactly the kind of
--  thing worth noticing manually; no automatic alerting is added here.
--
--  Called by verify/app.js right after a successful OTP verification, via a
--  SECURITY DEFINER function that takes the email from the caller's own JWT
--  (auth.jwt() ->> 'email') rather than trusting a client-supplied value —
--  an authenticated user can only ever bind their OWN verified email.
