--  P4P — RLS upgrade: anon-read  ->  authenticated + allow-listed read
-- ============================================================================
--  Context
--  -------
--  scripts/security-rls.sql previously let the PUBLIC anon key READ the roster
--  tables and p4p_submissions. That made the email-verification page cosmetic:
--  anyone with the (public) anon key could query Supabase directly and read the
--  same data without ever verifying.
--
--  This script closes that hole. After it runs:
--    • the roster tables (YYYY_MM) + p4p_submissions can only be READ by an
--      AUTHENTICATED session whose email is present in sender_physician_match;
--    • the anon role can no longer read any of that data;
--    • writes still require the service_role key (unchanged).
--
--  The front-end obtains a session via Supabase Auth email OTP on /verify/
--  (see verify/index.html + assets/auth-guard.js).
--
--  Supabase dashboard steps (do these BEFORE relying on the gate)
--  --------------------------------------------------------------
--    1. Authentication → Providers → Email: ENABLE. Turn OFF "Confirm email"
--       is not required for OTP; keep "Enable email provider" ON.
--    2. Authentication → Email Templates → "Magic Link": make sure the body
--       includes the numeric token, e.g.  {{ .Token }}  — otherwise Supabase
--       sends only a magic link and the 6-digit code box can't be used.
--    3. Keep "Allow new users to sign up" ON. The verify page uses
--       signInWithOtp(shouldCreateUser:true) so a newly-added physician can get
--       a session on first login; disabling signups would lock them out. RLS
--       below is what actually restricts data — not the signup toggle.
--    4. Configure SMTP (Authentication → SMTP) so OTP emails actually send in
--       production. The default Supabase mailer is rate-limited to a few/hour.
--    5. HARDENING (recommended):
--       • Auth → Sessions/Providers: shorten the Email OTP expiry (e.g. 300s).
--         A 6-digit code is only ~1e6 combinations; a long window widens brute
--         force. Also keep Supabase's built-in auth rate limits enabled.
--       • Auth → Providers: turn OFF "Anonymous sign-ins" — an anonymous JWT has
--         no email, so is_current_user_allowlisted() denies it (fails closed),
--         but there's no reason to allow minting such tokens at all.
--       • Anyone with the public key can trigger signInWithOtp for ANY address
--         (OTP email spam) and can call is_sender_allowlisted (a yes/no oracle
--         on whether an email is a physician). Neither exposes data — RLS still
--         gates that — but consider Supabase Auth rate limits / CAPTCHA if abuse
--         is seen.
--
--  Rollout order
--  -------------
--    1. Do the dashboard steps above and confirm you can receive an OTP.
--    2. Deploy the front-end (verify page + auth-guard + gated pages).
--    3. Run THIS file in the Supabase SQL editor to lock reads to authenticated
--       + allow-listed. (Running it before step 2 would lock out the live site.)
--
--  Onboarding new physicians (who haven't submitted P4P yet)
--  ----------------------------------------------------------
--  The allow-list is  physician_directory  UNION  sender_physician_match. A new
--  physician has no row in sender_physician_match until their first submission,
--  so add them to physician_directory (Supabase Table Editor → new row: email,
--  full_name, department) and they can verify immediately. If a physician tries
--  an email that isn't allow-listed, /verify/ records it in access_requests —
--  check that table (resolved = false) to see who still needs adding.
--
--  Verify (with the PUBLIC key, i.e. anon — everything should now be denied):
--    curl '.../rest/v1/2569_06?select=firstname'  -H "apikey:<pub>"   # -> [] / error
--  With a valid user JWT in Authorization: Bearer <jwt>, the same query returns
--  rows only if that user's email is in physician_directory or
--  sender_physician_match.
--
--  All blocks are idempotent.
-- ============================================================================


-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Block 0a — physician directory + access requests
--
--   physician_directory is an ADMIN-MAINTAINED allow-list, independent of who
--   has emailed. New physicians are added here (one row, via the Supabase Table
--   Editor) so they can verify BEFORE their first P4P submission. It is a
--   standalone table — NOT a column on the YYYY_MM roster tables, which are
--   recreated every month and would lose the emails on each import.
--
--   The effective allow-list is:  physician_directory  UNION  sender_physician_match
--   so everyone who has already emailed keeps working with no migration.
--
--   access_requests logs verify attempts from emails that are NOT allow-listed,
--   so admins can see who tried and needs adding. It is NOT an approval gate —
--   just visibility, so a real physician is never silently stuck.
--
--   Both tables hold email addresses, so they are locked down completely: no
--   anon/authenticated SELECT. They are only reachable via the SECURITY DEFINER
--   functions below (and the service_role key in the dashboard).

-- CRITICAL — lock the tables the allow-list is built from.
--   sender_physician_match holds physician emails+names and, because the
--   allow-list is (physician_directory UNION sender_physician_match), any row an
--   attacker could INSERT here would grant them access. It was never RLS-locked,
--   so with Supabase's default table grants the public/anon key could read the
--   whole email list AND potentially write to it (= allow-list tampering / auth
--   bypass). dept_heads similarly leaks head emails. Enable RLS with NO policy so
--   both are default-deny for anon/authenticated; the SECURITY DEFINER functions
--   (table owner) and the service_role key still reach them, so nothing breaks.
