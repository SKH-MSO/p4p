--  P4P — Denormalize LINE userId onto physician_directory / sender_physician_match
-- ============================================================================
--  Run scripts/bind-line-user.sql FIRST — this replaces bind_line_user_id()
--  again and depends on line_user_bindings, which stays the source of truth
--  (see that file: ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE only ever refreshes the display
--  name — the first bind's userId/bound_at are permanent).
--
--  Adds a line_user_id column directly to physician_directory and
--  sender_physician_match so it's visible right there in the Table Editor
--  without joining line_user_bindings. bind_line_user_id() now also writes to
--  whichever of these two tables has a row for that email — an allow-listed
--  email is guaranteed to be in at least one, sometimes both (see
--  line_binding_status's dedup logic for the "both" case).
--
--  The denormalized column always mirrors line_user_bindings's value (the
--  immutable, first-bind userId), not whatever a later call happens to pass
--  in — so if an admin later adds a NEW physician_directory row for an email
--  that was already bound via sender_physician_match (e.g. formally
--  onboarding someone who'd previously only auto-matched), re-running the
--  backfill query at the bottom fills in that new row from history instead of
--  it looking falsely "unmatched".
-- ============================================================================

--  NOTE: the SQL editor sends a pasted multi-statement script as one implicit
--  transaction — if anything below the ALTER TABLEs fails, Postgres rolls
--  EVERYTHING in this submission back, including columns that "succeeded"
--  moments earlier (this is almost certainly why the columns didn't stick the
--  first time). The explicit `commit;` below closes that transaction right
--  after the columns are added, so they're durable even if a later statement
--  errors.
